<h2>What is a Smart city?</h2><br><br><br>
<div>A <p class="ex2">Smart city</p> is a municipality that uses information and communication technologies (ICT) to increase operational efficiency, share information with the public and improve both the quality of government services and citizen welfare.
While the exact definition varies, the overarching mission of a <p class="ex2">smart city</p> is to optimize city functions and drive economic growth while improving quality of life for its citizens using smart technology and data analysis. Value is given to the <p class="ex2">smart city</p> based on what they choose to do with the technology, not just how much technology they may have.</p>
<h3>Smart City Technology</h3>
<div><p class="ex2">Smart city</p> use a combination of the <p class="ex2">internet of things (IoT) devices</p>, software solutions, user interfaces (UI) and communication networks. However, they rely first and foremost on the IoT. The IoT is a network of connected devices -- such as vehicles, sensors or home appliances -- that can communicate and exchange data. Data collected and delivered by the <p class="ex2">IoT sensors and devices</p> is stored in the cloud or on servers. The connection of these devices and use of data analytics (DA) facilitates the convergence of the physical and digital city elements, thus improving both public and private sector efficiency, enabling economic benefits and improving citizen's lives.

    The <p class="ex2">IoT</p> devices sometimes have processing capabilities called edge computing. Edge computing ensures that only the most important and relevant information is communicated over the communication network.
    
    A <p class="ex2">Firewall security system</p> is also necessary for the protection, monitoring and control of network traffic within a computing system. Firewalls ensure that the data constantly being transmitted within a <p class="ex2">smart city network</p> is secure by preventing any unauthorized access to the IoT network or city data.</div>
<h3>Why we need smart cities?</h3>
<div>The primary goal of a smart city is to create an urban environment that yields a high quality of life to its residents while also generating overall economic growth. Therefore, a major advantage of smart cities is their ability <p class="ex2">to facilitate an increased delivery of services to citizens with less infrastructure and cost!</p>
    Smart city applications enable cities to find and create new value from their existing infrastructure. The improvements facilitate new revenue streams and operational efficiencies, helping governments and citizens save money.
